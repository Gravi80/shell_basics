The general job control commands in Linux are:

jobs - list the current jobs
fg - resume the job that's next in the queue
fg %[number] - resume job [number]
bg - Push the next job in the queue into the background
bg %[number] - Push the job [number] into the background
kill %[number] - Kill the job numbered [number]
kill -[signal] %[number] - Send the signal [signal] to job number [number]
disown %[number] - disown the process(no more terminal will be owner), so command will be alive even after closing the terminal.

Now, for the sake of completeness, here are two common shortcuts which aid in job handling:
Ctrl+Z - suspend a job.
Ctrl+C - terminate a job.
Once a job is suspended, it is added to the jobs list, so you can manage it using the mentioned commands.

 Note the % infront of the job number in the commands - this is what tells kill you're talking about jobs and not processes.
